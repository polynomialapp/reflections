What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repo, a .git file is created in the container folder.
That file tracks all the changes—the version history.
You need to do it in order to use git—git doesn't track a repo unless you tell it to.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is just a holding tank for regulating what commits go into the repo at a given time.
It doesn't contain the current, working code or any of the previous versions and has no use outside of making commits.
Since it allows you to pick out individual files, you can make your commits discrete.
